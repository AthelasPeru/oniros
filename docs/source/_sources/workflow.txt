The Workflow
===============

**Oniros** was build with a particular workflow in sight, but we think it's flexible enough for front/wordpress developers 
that want to use customizable tools and a `Gulp workflow <http://gulpjs.com/>`_.

The goal is to help developers deliver the best product they can without having to spend hours configuring basic 
stuff every *top notch* Wordpress template should have.

With **Oniros** developers can focus on complex tasks the client might require, like custom plugins, integrations, etc. Organization of your files and frontend building tools shouldn't bother you on a per project basis!
