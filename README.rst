Oniros is our base template for building really good wordpress templates.
It was build to optimize our workflow and ensure best practices and similar patterns on our projects.
We try to cover most usecases we encounter on a daily basis, so we don't have to be searching on old folders for the solution or way to implement
something we build for a project 2 months ago.
